## team and access : 

Wag3s empowers you to manage administrator accounts. You can designate your collaborators, assemble your team, and control access rights.

Revealed upcoming Modules: With Wag3s, you will have the ability to share different views, allowing you to grant visibility to your accountant for instance, the auditors, and even your investors! They will have full transparency regarding the proper use of their funds (if you grant them access, of course).

Furthermore, there will be a public mode that allows your company to present your accounts and reports to the public, enhancing transparency in the world of crypto. (Note that this mode is limited, and you will have control over the information you share.)

Lastly, a public ranking of companies will be offered, showcasing the most performance-driven companies and those generating the highest revenue (and, for once, all your revenue will be taken into account!).
