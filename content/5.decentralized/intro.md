## Decentralized secret storage of data

#### our Private Data, Completely Secure:
First and foremost, everyone will have the choice of where to store their data. This approach aims to make those who are more familiar with Web2 less apprehensive about blockchain technology and decentralization. Users will be given the option to store their private data while being informed about the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

Secure Database Storage as in Any Conventional Platform:
You can securely store your data on our servers or locally on your own server. We can create backups in case you lose your local data.

Advantage: In case of hardware failure or user error, you can recover your data as we maintain a backup of your settings.

Disadvantage: No system is infallible, and having your data and a backup on our server means you are not the sole owner of your data.

### Decentralized Data Storage - The Full Web3 Solution:
You can save your data with absolute confidentiality, and you will be the sole owner of the data.
Disadvantage: If you lose access or an error occurs, unfortunately, we won't be able to restore your settings since we do not store any of your data.
The decentralized option is still in development to offer several solutions that are the most efficient and quick.
